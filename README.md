# word-transformer

Given two words of equal length that are in a dictionary, write a C# program to transform one word into another word by changing only one letter at a time. The new word in each step must be in the dictionary. 

<br/>Example:
<br/>Input: DAMP, LIKE
<br/>Output: DAMP->LAMP->LIMP->LIME->LIKE
